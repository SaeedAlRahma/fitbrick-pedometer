# fitbrick-pedometer
A fitbit-like pedometer

This project uses and Arduino Nano with an LCD, an accelerometer, a switch, and a battery pack to build a fitbit-like pedometer. 
The electonic parts are enclosed in 3D printed casing. 

The main functin of the fitbrick is to measure steps, but it contains more modes and features:

1. Monitor steps
2. Display total lifetime steps
3. Display resetable number of steps
4. LCD change colors based on level of activity
5. Display moment-to-moment acceleration
6. Apnea detection
7. Stopwatch
8. Re-calibrate sensor
